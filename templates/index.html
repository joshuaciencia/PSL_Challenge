	<p>
	There is a Tusavirus outbreak in Colombia. A national emergency has been declared by the
	government. The government has requested each governor to report the number of victims in
	their jurisdiction on a virtual platform.
	While panicking, governors could send the requested information in inconsistent formats.
	Some could send digits, or use their smartphoneâ€™s speech-to-text, while others will send data
	in the wrong format because of the sense of urgency.
